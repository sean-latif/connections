# Connec-seans v2: From Russia With Love
In order to clean up the code a little, or at least have smaller files, I decided to convert what I had to custom HTML elements. I had worked with these briefly many years ago but that was for a weird Angular CLI effort. This was a good exercise in separating concerns/purposes. I don't know much about ReactJS at all but if it's anything like Angular then should make it an easier conversion process.

Updates:
- Custom HTML Elements: divided components of game into custom HTML elements

Bug fixes:
- "One away..." would appear if the guess was 2 away
